## Archive access functionality

Note: The files in this directory are an experimental implementation of support for different archive files that can contain 3D Tiles data. This is not part of a public API, and may be modified or removed in the future. 

Parts of these files are based on https://github.com/bjornblissing/3d-tiles-tools/blob/2f4844d5bdd704509bff65199898981228594aaa/validator/lib/archive.js
