## Archvie access functionality

Note: The files in this directory are an experimental implementation of support for different archive files that can contain 3D Tiles data. This is not part of a public API, and may be modified or removed in the future. 

Parts of these files are based on https://github.com/erikdahlstrom/3d-tiles-tools/blob/0b48a4287df0c0361961c7072f8eec49527df1ac/validator/lib/archive.js - SEE THE LICENSING INFORMATION IN THIS FILE!
