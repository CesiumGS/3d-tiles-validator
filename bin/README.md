The `main` file in this directory is the entry point for the validator application when it is installed from an NPM package. It is defined as the entry point via the `bin` property of the main `package.json`.

It only sets up the Node execution environment for the validator, as required as of https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/v9/configuring-npm/package-json#bin . Beyond that, it just includes `main.js`. 

It is copied to the `build` directory by the `package-copy` script of the `package.json`, before generating the release package (similar to https://github.com/microsoft/TypeScript/blob/main/bin )
